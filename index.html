<h2>Reasons to attend</h2>
<p>Let's face it, if you've not been to one of our events before, when we say "a conference for the Web Industry", your eyes are glazing over. You're thinking "nerdy guys who cut code". You're thinking "just another conference". Perfectly understandable, but in this case, completely wrong. So what is it?</p>

<p>Take the world's leading digital creatives, like long time Creative Director at Twitter Douglas Bowman (who it happens spoke at our very first ever conference 10 years ago–we're good at spotting trends), and the Design Director of the Obama for America Campaign, Scott Thomas. And industry redefining engineering talent, like Bill Scott, Senior Director for Business Engineering at Paypal worldwide.</p>

<p>Mix in an atmosphere decidedly unlike any you've experienced at a conference. Add parties, bespoke espresso and pour-over coffee, and all manner of experiences to engage, delight, and stimulate your creativity and conversation. And that barely begins to do justice to the event that is Web Directions.</p>

<p>Now you're thinking, "it sounds awesome, but I can't afford the time to take two days off no matter how good this might be". But the question really is, in such a fast moving industry as ours, can you afford not to?</p>

					<h3>Keynote: Tobias Revell</h3>
					<h4>Designed Conflict Territories 2</h4>
					
					<section class="abstract">
<p>The ongoing project of the state's need to make the world legible resulted in dragnet surveillance and the ongoing legally-framed landgrab of network colonialism.</p>
<p>The network has become a vast, dark territory reflecting our own but at an abstract angle. Power is brief and fickle and flashes and bubbles as we learn to understand and love the monster we created and those who inhabit it. What potential for the future of this network is there and what are the pitfalls of our romance?</p>

					<h3>Keynote: Dan Hon</h3>
					<h4>An Internet for humans, too</h4>
					
					<section class="abstract">
<p>40 years of Moore’s law has meant that computing and communications power has gotten cheaper, smaller and faster. It’s not new news to say that soon everything will have an IP address. And yet. All this excitement of an internet of things is against the background of a shift in the world, a change in the way that Silicon Valley and the rest of the world is building the new products that are changing our lives, in the way established businesses are operating, and in the way that governments interact with us.
Some organizations are learning the hard way, others are making decisive moves. But all of this points to an inescapable fact: in the internet of things, humans are things too. And there’s a gap in empathy between these organisations and us, as audiences, citizens, consumers and people.</p>

<p>Designing an internet of things that’s for humans means understanding what the empathy gap is. It’s the gap in understanding between an organization and its audience. This session is the story of how, whilst a more connected world means more things, we should remember to design those things, products and services to understand us.</p>					</section>

<p>Dan Hon is a former creative director from the independent advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, based in Portland, Oregon. He's worked as an interactive creative director on Nike, Kraft, Sony and Coca-Cola and most recently as a creative director on Facebook, bringing to life their first brand campaign. </p>

<p>A recovered lawyer, he helped Mind Candy build their first product, Perplex City, and co-founded Six to Start, an award-winning entertainment production company in 2007. </p>

<p>He has been blogging for a very long time and now writes a popular email newsletter. He doesn’t play World of Warcraft anymore.</p>

						<h4>Building trust</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Great work is rarely the result of a single person. It often takes the combined efforts of many to create great products and services. At the heart of these efforts is trust. Trust is the unifying force that facilitates execution at speed. It is the glue that binds a team together, and is critical to maximizing efficiency and impact amongst your peers. Learn how to create trust in yourself, amongst your team members, and with your users.</p>

						<h3>Product: Younghee Jung</h3>
						<h4>Open for open questions</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Many design and usability research methods cater for delving into a focused topic: You set a goal, establish hypotheses, gather data and gain insight to help create the proof, story, a view point, strategy, or whatever you are looking for – within the given budget and time. However, there can be situations where your research may focus too much on individual ‘trees’ that it cannot provide much information about the ‘forest’. For instance, what if you have perfect usability test data to prove the effectiveness of your design, but your client may be more interested to know what types of people would buy the product (and get disappointed to hear that you don’t know)? What if your polite research participants never want to talk with you about negative things about your design? This talk will share a few anecdotes exemplifying the importance of factoring in the space when exploring broader viewpoints to the user research questions, through informal social encounters, serendipitous interactions, and activities that are designed for cross-examining their results.</p>

						<h3>Product: Tom Armitage</h3>
						<h4>What Things Are</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>If we're going to talk about an Internet of Things, we should probably talk about what we mean when we say &quot;thing&quot;</p>
						
<p>So often, when we talk about the &quot;internet of things&quot; it brings to mind images of consumer white goods with an Ethernet sockets or Wifi antennas. Thermostats; weighing scales; the apocryphal Internet Fridge. But that's a narrow way of thinking that's perhaps unhelpful: whatever you may think of the term, an &quot;Internet of Things&quot; should embrace the diversity of Thingness.</p>

<p>So what happens when you think about the diversity of things that might be on the internet, and how they might behave? What about Things that people don't necessarily own, but borrow, share, or inhabit? Through projects that connected bikes, bridges, and a whole city to the network, let's think about What Things Are&mdash;and what they might be.														</p>

						<h3>Product: Jessica Hische</h3>
						<h4>My Illustrious Ascent Toward &quot;Less Exciting&quot; Work</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Designers try desperately to make work that’s impactful—to create work that will leave people breathless and hungry for more. Young designers in particular are endlessly trying to impress, their designs scream “DESIGN!”, their type choices are bold, their color palettes are disruptive. Many designers carry this momentum throughout there careers, but there are a few that begin to see differently. </p>

<p>Instead of focusing on the flash, they hone in on the details, noticing things that others can barely perceive. Does this make their work better? Does it make it boring? Jessica will guide you through her own work and show you what happens when the small and imperceptible becomes even more exciting than the big bright and flashy.</p>

						<h4>Elements of API Excellence</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>APIs are now everywhere and interoperability is assumed to be a standard feature of many products. However, the promise of interconnectedness cannot be fulfilled by ubiquity of connectivity alone. Nor is a great API design enough to be successful. APIs are not about exposing data, but exposing capabilities. They're not about connecting machines, but connecting people.</p>

<p>This session will focus on evaluating the maturity of APIs as a consumer and increasing your value as a provider. I will share my experience researching developers' needs from their first impressions through to their successful integrations.</p>						</section>

						<h4>Unpacking Technical Decisions</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Every day, we make hundreds of small technical decisions: what’s the best way to implement this? Where should this function live? Is this library worth using? Occasionally, we make a larger decision: would a different framework make us more productive? Should we rewrite the whole thing in C?</p>

<p>No matter what scale we’re talking about, our decision making leans heavily on past experience, our community, and usually a search engine. But beyond that, the process is mostly opaque. Two programmers, given the same data, often make different decisions. We all want to be the one who’s usually right, but…how do we get there?</p>

<p>Let’s unpack our technical decision-making process, and see what we can learn about getting better at programming. Is mastery really something you just have to wait for? Can you accelerate it? And just what does “productivity” mean, anyway? We’ll take a tour of the science and figure out how we can apply it to the decisions we make every day.</p>						</section>

						<h3>Engineering: Julio Cesar Ody</h3>
						<h4>The Loaded JavaScript</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
						<p>As our JavaScript becomes less monolithic, we're loading more and more small pieces of code, with all kinds of subtle interdependencies. There's all manner of module systems, script loaders, patterns and practices, to manage loading our JavaScript, not to mention the increasingly widely supported <code>defer</code> and <code>async</code> attributes of the <code>script</code> element. But what's really the best way to load your JavaScript to ensure all dependencies are met, with minimal impact on performance? Let Julio give you his as always considered opinion.</p>

						<h3>Engineering: Bill Scott</h3>
						<h4>Lean Engineering: how to make engineering a full lean UX partner</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>In 1999, PayPal's name was synonymous with innovation. In fact, the so called PayPal Mafia (original founders) went on to establish Tesla, SpaceX, YouTube, Skype and other startups. They also provided the early investments of many of the most innovative companies on the internet today. But over time that innovation slowed to a crawl.</p>

<p>In 2011 a number of things begin to come together for PayPal that started its journey back to innovation. This is the story of that reboot and how engineering has played a key role in partnering directly with product and design to move from a culture of products having a long shelf life, to one of rapid experimentation.</p>

<p>In this talk, Bill will outline the principles of Lean Engineering; principles for engineering that enable learning. Drawing from his experience leading User Interface Engineering at both Netflix & PayPal, Bill will walk you through the key principles your engineering team will need to adopt to be that enabler for product and design in your organization. This talk will not just inspire you, but it will also give you some hard earned advice on making this a reality in your organization.	</p>					</section>

						<h4>The Operable Front End</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Operations engineers sometimes use the term "operability" when they talk about the ingredients for fast, stable, maintainable applications. While operability is usually discussed in the context of back-end systems, there's no reason instrumentation and observability should stop at the app server. This talk will take a broad look at what operability can mean in the context of the browser, and it'll lay out the metrics and tools that are needed to have operable front end code. We'll also look at some production situations where good client-side instrumentation uncovered an unexpected facet of performance, security, or user behavior. Finally, we'll dig into how to employ all of these metrics and techniques in service of a faster, more responsive end user experience.</p>						</section>

						<h4>Bit rot in the documentation</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract"><p>How to identify, fix, and prevent document decay.</p>

<p>The very mention of bit rot will strike terror into an engineer’s heart. Unused programs or features will often stop working after sufficient time has passed, even if ‘nothing has changed’. (From the hacker’s Jargon File.) Bit rot affects documentation too. Whether the cause be a changing environment, human error, or the infamous cosmic rays, we need to root out that rot.</p>

<p>But who has time to read and test the documentation on a regular basis? That’s the least efficient and most error-prone way of detecting doc decay. </p>

<p>Join me to explore the ways in which documentation can degenerate over time. We’ll look at innovative techniques for finding and fixing errors. Together we will ward off those cosmic rays!</p></section>

<p>Tracking data changes and presenting them to the user is a fundamental part of any web application. In the past, this behaviour has largely been achieved with custom model types or dirty state checking. With Object.observe, JavaScript now offers us a much simpler alternative for tracking model changes over time. In this talk we'll examine how this new language feature works, and how it can vastly improve the way we handle data in our applications.</p>
