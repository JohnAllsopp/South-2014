			<h2>Reasons to attend</h2>
	
			<p>Let's face it, if you've not been to one of our events before, when we say "a conference for the Web Industry", your eyes are glazing over. You're thinking "nerdy guys who cut code". You're thinking "just another conference". Perfectly understandable. But in this case, completely wrong. So what the heck is it?</p>
			
			<p>Take the world's leading digital creatives, like long time Creative Director at Twitter Douglas Bowman (who it happens spoke at our very first ever conference 10 years ago–we're good at spotting trends), and the Design Director of the Obama for America Campaign, Scott Thomas. And Industry redefining Engineering talent, like Bill Scott, Senior Director for Business Engineering at Paypal worldwide.</p>
			
			<p>Mix in an atmosphere decidedly unlike any you've experienced at a conference. Add parties, bespoke espresso and pour-over coffee, and all manner of experiences to engage, delight, and stimulate your creativity and conversation. And that barely begins to do justice to the event that is Web Directions.</p>	
			
<p>Now you're thinking, "it sounds awesome, but I can't afford the time to take two days off no matter how good this might be". The question really is, in such a fast moving Industry as ours, can you afford <em>not</em> to?</p>

					<h3>Keynote: Tobias Revell</h3>
					<h4>Designed Conflict Territories 2</h4>
					
					<section class="abstract">
<p>The ongoing project of the state's need to make the world legible resulted in dragnet surveillance and the ongoing legally-framed landgrab of network colonialism.</p>
<p>The network has become a vast, dark territory reflecting our own but at an abstract angle. Power is brief and fickle and flashes and bubbles as we learn to understand and love the monster we created and those who inhabit it. What potential for the future of this network is there and what are the pitfalls of our romance?</p>

					<h3>Keynote: Dan Hon</h3>
					<h4>An Internet for humans, too</h4>
					
					<section class="abstract">
					<p>40 years of Moore’s law has meant that computing and communications power everywhere has gotten cheaper, smaller and faster. It’s not new news to say that soon everything will have an IP address. And yet.</p>

<p>All this excitement of an internet of things coming about is against the background of a shift in the world, a change in the way that Silicon Valley and the rest of the world is building the new products that are changing our lives, in the way established businesses are operating, and in the way that governments are deciding to interact with us. </p>

<p>Some of these organizations are learning the hard way, whereas others are making decisive moves. But all of this points to an inescapable fact: in the internet of things, humans are things too. And there’s a gap in empathy between these organisations and us, as audiences, citizens, consumers and people. </p>

<p>Designing an internet of things that’s for humans means understanding what the empathy gap is. It’s the gap in understanding between an organization and its audience.</p>

<p>This session is the story of how, whilst a more connected world means more things, we should remember to design those things, products and services to understand us.</p>

<p>He has been blogging for a very long time and now writes a popular email newsletter. He doesn’t play World of Warcraft anymore.</p>

						<h4>Building better products with content strategy</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Web sites, blogs, and social presences often aren't enough to keep your audience engaged. We've entered the age of apps, where content is a product in and of itself. But how do you take the next step to build useful products with great content? This is a job for content strategy.</p>

<p>Great work is rarely the result of a single person. It often takes the combined efforts of many to create great products and services. At the heart of these efforts is trust. Trust is the unifying force that facilitates execution at speed. It is the glue that binds a team together, and is critical to maximizing efficiency and impact amongst your peers. Learn how to create trust in yourself, amongst your team members, and with your users.</p>

						<h3>Product: Younghee Jung</h3>
						<h4>Open for open questions</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Many design and usability research methods cater for delving into a focused topic: You set a goal, establish hypotheses, gather data and gain insight to help create the proof, story, a view point, strategy, or whatever you are looking for – within the given budget and time. However, there can be situations where your research may focus too much on individual ‘trees’ that it cannot provide much information about the ‘forest’. For instance, what if you have perfect usability test data to prove the effectiveness of your design, but your client may be more interested to know what types of people would buy the product (and get disappointed to hear that you don’t know)? What if your polite research participants never want to talk with you about negative things about your design? This talk will share a few anecdotes exemplifying the importance of factoring in the space when exploring broader viewpoints to the user research questions, through informal social encounters, serendipitous interactions, and activities that are designed for cross-examining their results.</p>

						<h3>Product: Jessica Hische</h3>
						<h4>My Illustrious Ascent Toward &quot;Less Exciting&quot; Work</h4>
					
						<section class="abstract">
<p>Designers try desperately to make work that’s impactful—to create work that will leave people breathless and hungry for more. Young designers in particular are endlessly trying to impress, their designs scream “DESIGN!”, their type choices are bold, their color palettes are disruptive. Many designers carry this momentum throughout there careers, but there are a few that begin to see differently. </p>

<p>Instead of focusing on the flash, they hone in on the details, noticing things that others can barely perceive. Does this make their work better? Does it make it boring? Jessica will guide you through her own work and show you what happens when the small and imperceptible becomes even more exciting than the big bright and flashy.</p>

She is currently serving on the Type Directors Club board of directors, has traveled the world speaking about lettering and illustration, and has probably consumed enough coffee to power a small nation.</p>
