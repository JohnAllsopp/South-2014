			<h2>Reasons to attend</h2>
	
			<p>Let's face it, if you've not been to one of our events before, when we say "a conference for the Web Industry", your eyes are glazing over. You're thinking "nerdy guys who cut code". You're thinking "just another conference". Perfectly understandable. But in this case, completely wrong. So what the heck is it?</p>
			
			<p>Take the world's leading digital creatives, like long time Creative Director at Twitter Douglas Bowman (who it happens he spoke at our very first ever conference 10 years ago–we're good at spotting trends), and the Design Director for the Obama for America Campaign, Scott Thomas. And Industry redefining Engineering talent, like Bill Scott, Senior Director for Business Engineering at Paypal worldwide.</p>
			
			<p>Mix in an atmosphere decidedly unlike any you've experienced at a conference. Add parties, bespoke espresso and pour-over coffee, and all manner of experiences to engage, delight, and stimulate your creativity and conversation. And that barely begins to do justice to the event that is Web Directions.</p>	
			
<p>Now you're thinking, I can't afford the time to take two days off no matter how good this might be. But the question really is, in such a fast moving Industry as ours, can you afford not to?</p>

					<h3>Keynote: Tobias Revell</h3>
					<h4>The monopoly of legitimate use</h4>
					
					<section class="abstract">
					<p>The Monopoly of Legitimate Use takes the very physical notion of inhabiting a space or territory into the technological world, where networks can form political territories and places where people can gather and align themselves to particular ideological beliefs.</p>

<p>The three films, Bumper, Blackspot and Stateless explore three individuals – migrants and refugees – in a near future, moving between the layers of this vertical geography to try and find refuge or exploit the geography to their benefit.</p>

<p>The films raise questions about the tools and methods we use to identify ourselves politically as well as the rebalance of control caused by network technology that is simultaneously globalising and localising.</p>

					<section class="bio">
					
					<p>Tobias Revell was born in a Hampshire town built around a system of roundabouts in late 1986. His second ever memory is gazing at a tropical fish tank in the bar of a Welsh bed and breakfast while the room crowded with adults watching the fall of the Berlin Wall on the one small television available. His first memory involves filling the doors of a Porsche with sand.
